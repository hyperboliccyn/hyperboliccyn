Hi! I'm Cynthia!

I enjoy studying and learning about many different topics! Currently, I am studying topics in Mathematics, Materials Science, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Classical Studies.


I plan to work in academia, both in instruction and in research. I love discussing many many topics across lots of fields, and am always enthusiastic to learn even more!


But my most favorite thing in the world - is you hugging me :D.
